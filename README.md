## External Dependencies

- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) is used as primary storage for all media information. It needs to either be installed locally, or on another machine on the local network that your tsukimi installation will share.
- [XBake](https://bitbucket.org/yellowcrescent/yc_xbake) is invoked by tsukimi to perform all media scraping, scanning, and cataloging tasks. It can also be used for transcoding and hardsubbing videos.
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) is used for caching, queues (such as playlists), and many other things that benefit from fast, easy, semi-volatile storage.


## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

This assumes that Node.js, `npm`, Ruby 1.9+, and `gem` are already installed.

For development, install the SDK build of NW.js, which allows using the Chromium Developer Tools.
If you don't want/need the SDK build, remove the `--nwjs_build_type=sdk` option.

```
sudo npm install -g nw --nwjs_build_type=sdk
```

Install Sass & Compass

```
sudo gem install compass
```

Install Bower & Grunt-cli

```
sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

### Fetch & Build

Clone git repo from Bitbucket

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/yellowcrescent/tsukimi
cd tsukimi
```

Install Node modules

```
npm install
```

Compile stylesheets

```
compass compile
```

Install Bower components

```
cd public
bower install
```

### Configure

Create a JSON file in the installation base named `settings.json` and populate at least the
following parameters (with common or example values shown below)

```
{
	"mongo": "mongodb://localhost:27017/tsukimi",
	"data_dir": "/opt/tsukimi",
	"xbake_path": "/usr/local/bin/yc_xbake"
}
```

### Run

From the base source directory (directory containing `package.json`), execute `nw` or use `npm`:

```
npm start
```
